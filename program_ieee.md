## BioVis Challenges Workshop Agenda

### Workshop Scope
This year’s workshop will be focusing on challenges related to the **Visualization of Cancer Genomics Data**. Thanks to the decreasing cost of next-generation sequencing, and the efforts by major consortiums including The Cancer Genome Atlas ([TCGA](https://cancergenome.nih.gov/)) and the International Cancer Genome Consortium ([ICGC](http://icgc.org/)), cancer genomics continues to be a field with exciting developments and findings, but also leading to increasing number of challenges that provide opportunities for visualisation to make a difference within the analysis of the data generated.

Within this domain, there are already a multitude of well-known challenges, such as comparing the genomic sequences, and transcriptomes of tumor cells with those of normal cells, or the comprehensive characterisation of different types and subtypes of cancer, as well as several clinical applications such as improved diagnosis of cancer, prenatal screening, or the design of targeted therapeutic agents, to name a few. There are several cancer genomics data sets that are readily available ([GENIE](http://www.aacr.org/Research/Research/Pages/aacr-project-genie.aspx), [TCGA](https://cancergenome.nih.gov/)) and several platforms provide APIs to access such data sets (e.g. [cBio Portal](http://www.cbioportal.org/), [GDC](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/)).

### Preliminary Timeline
**When:** October 2nd, 2017, 8:30 - 12:10

**Location:** 207LH, Phoenix Convention Center (for further details see the [http://ieeevis.org/](http://ieeevis.org/))

        <div class="tabstract"><b>Abstract:</b>
        Jeremy Warner MD, MS is an Associate Professor of Medicine and Biomedical Informatics at Vanderbilt University, where he also directs the Vanderbilt Cancer Registry and Stem Cell Transplant Data Analysis Team. He is board certified in Internal Medicine, Medical Oncology, Hematology, and Clinical Informatics; his clinical focus is malignant hematology. His primary research goal is to make sense of the structured and unstructured data present in electronic health records (EHRs) and clinical knowledge bases to directly improve clinical care for patients, with a focus on oncology. This includes high-dimensional data analysis and visualization, natural language processing of cancer-oriented narratives, and development/implementation of oncology-specific health IT standards. He is the chief software architect of <em><a href="http://www.vicc.org/smart-pcm/">SMART Precision Cancer Medicine</a>,</em> and leads the Vanderbilt pilot site of <em><a href="http://www.sync4genes.org/">Sync for Genes</a></em>. He is a member of the <em><a href="https://allofus.nih.gov/about/program-components/data-research-center">All of Us Research Program’s Data and Research Support Center</a></em>.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Fun fact:</b> in a past life he was a DJ and threw at least one rave in a subbasement.
