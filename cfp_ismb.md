# Call for Participation: BioVis@ISMB 2018
**Community of Special Interest (COSI) event at [ISMB 2018](https://www.iscb.org/ismb2018https://www.iscb.org/ismb2018)**  
**July 6-10, 2018 (the precise day will be announced soon)**  
**Chicago, USA**


## Aims and Scope

The rapidly expanding field of biology creates enormous challenges for data visualization techniques that enable researchers to gain insight from their large and highly complex data sets.

The BioVis Interest Group organizes the interdisciplinary event BioVis, covering all aspects of visualization in biology. This symposium brings together researchers from the visualization, bioinformatics, and biology communities with the purpose of educating, inspiring, and engaging visualization researchers in problems in biological data visualization as well as bioinformatics and biology researchers in state-of-the-art visualization research.

We invite submissions of original research articles as well as poster submissions.

## Symposium Format

The symposium will be a one-day single-track event at [ISMB](https://www.iscb.org/ismb2018). The event will feature keynote and invited talks, paper sessions, highlight talks, and posters/demos. Primers acting as tutorial introductions to visualization topics will be provided. 

## Topics

We invite contributions on all aspects of data visualization in biology, from molecular to cell, tissue, organism and population biology. Suggested topics for paper and poster submissions include, but are not limited to:

 * Genome and sequence data, including genomic variation data
 * Multivariate omics data (transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, etc.)
 * Phylogenetic data
 * Biological networks and pathways
 * Biological ontologies
 * Macromolecular structures (e.g., protein or RNA structures)
 * Biological image data, such as microscopy data
 * Integration of image and omics data for systems biology
 * Modeling and simulation of biological systems
 * Neurobiology and developmental biology
 * Systems and software frameworks
 * Biological workflows or collaborative processes
 * Usability of visualization by biologists
 * Biological atlases and metadata
 * Processes for interdisciplinary collaboration between biology and visualization.

## Submission Types and Criteria

There are several possibilities to contribute to the program of BioVis:

### 1. ISMB Proceedings - *Submission Deadline: January 29, 2018*

Novel, unpublished work can be submitted as a paper to the ISMB Proceedings. If accepted, manuscripts will be published in the [OUP Journal Bioinformatics](http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/). Authors of accepted papers will be required to present their work at the symposium in a talk. Authors of rejected papers will be invited to submit a poster. 

#### Submission Guidelines

Authors are required to submit a full paper by January 29, 2018 at the [BioVis submission page](https://www.iscb.org/ismb2018-submit/proceedings).

Papers must adhere to the [ISMB Submission Guidelines](https://www.iscb.org/ismb2018-submit/proceedings). We encourage the use of digital video to enhance paper submissions, particularly if part or all of the work addresses interactive techniques. However, please note that OUP does not support videos as supplementary materials, so you will have to host the video elsewhere (e.g., YouTube).



### 2. Highlight Talks - *Submission Deadline: April 5, 2018*

Participants are encouraged to submit abstracts describing their recently published work related to biological data visualization.  Highlight submissions will be reviewed by the chairs and by external reviewers. If accepted, participants are required to present their work in a talk at the symposium. Authors of rejected highlights will be invited to submit a poster.

#### Submission Guidelines

Authors are required to submit a short abstract (250 words)  by April 5, 2018. Summaries should include a concise description of the work and may include descriptive figures. The previously published paper must be submitted along with the summary.

### 3. Posters - *Submission Deadline: April 5, 2018*

We invite participants to submit work in progress and preliminary results, previously published work from other venues, or visualization challenges to be presented as a poster. A selection of these will be invited to give a short talk during the conference.

#### Submission Guidelines

Authors are required to submit a short abstract (250 words) and a supporting figure by April 5, 2018. Abstracts should include a concise description of an idea, work in progress, preliminary results, visualization challenges, or results from previously published work at other venues relevant for the BioVis community. If the submission is based on previous work, the published paper must be submitted along with the summary.

Poster preparation instructions will be e-mailed to authors of accepted submissions.


## Submission Policies and Ethics Guidelines

At least one author of an accepted submission must attend the event to present the work. To avoid potential conflicts of interest when assigning reviewers, the complete list of authors must to be provided when submitting your manuscript, poster abstract, or highlight. Paper submissions **are double-blind**, i.e., you must anonymize your submission. The list of authors will not be communicated to the reviewers. Adding additional authors after the submission deadline will not be permitted. 

Poster and highlights submissions are single-blind. 

All submissions will be treated as confidential communications during the review process, so a submission does not constitute public disclosure of any ideas therein. Submissions should contain no information or materials that will be proprietary or confidential at the time of publication (at the conference), and should cite no publications that are proprietary or confidential at the time of publication.

Any use of copyrighted material and devices of proprietary nature will be the responsibility of the presenters.

Our workshop will adhere to the VGTC ethics guidelines for reviewers that can be found at the [VGTC Website](http://vgtc.org/about_us/conferences/ethics-guidelines).

## Review Process

Paper submissions will be managed by the Papers Chairs and sent to external reviewers - from both the visualization and bioinformatics communities - to evaluate the worksâ€™ novelty and significance. 

Poster and highlights submissions will be reviewed for relevance and interest to the BioVis community by the Poster chair, the Papers Chairs, and external reviewers.


## Important Dates

All deadlines are at 23:59 (11:59pm) Pacific time zone.
