### Community of Special Interest (COSI) event at [ISMB2018](https://www.iscb.org/ismb2018)

Biovis 2018 will be organized again as a 1-day workshop at ISMB (Conference on Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology) in Chicago, which will take place from 6-10 July 2018 at the Hyatt Regency Hotel in **Chicago, IL**. As in previous years, this workshop brings together experts at the interface of biology/bioinformatics and data visualization.

Contributions will be invited on all aspects of data visualization in biology, and can take the form of one of the following contributions:

 1. **Proceedings:** You can submit a paper that, if accepted,  will be published in Bioinformatics (Impact Factor: 7.3). You will be also be asked to present this paper at the conference.

2. **Abstracts:** A selection of submitted shorter abstracts will be invited to present at the conference. Abstract-based talks can be highlights (i.e. where the work was previously published elsewhere, but significant additional work has been done), or breaking new research.

3. **Posters**
