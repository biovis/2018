## BioVis Challenges Workshop at IEEE VIS 2018, Berlin, Germany

### Aims, Scope & Objectives

The rapidly expanding field of biology creates enormous challenges for data visualization techniques that enable researchers to gain insight from their large and highly complex data sets.

The BioVis Interest Group organizes this interdisciplinary workshop at IEEE VIS, covering aspects of visualization in biology. This workshop brings together researchers from the visualization, bioinformatics, and biology communities with the purpose of educating, inspiring, and engaging visualization researchers in problems in biological data visualization. The goal of this workshop is to create synergies and spark potential future collaborations between domain experts and vis researchers around state-of-the-art biology-driven challenges.

### Workshop Format
BioVis Challenges Workshop is a half-day event organised in conjunction with IEEE VIS 2018 taking place on October 21st to October 26th, 2018 in Berlin, Germany. The workshop will be focusing on a state-of-the-art biological challenge that requires a concerted effort from researchers in visualisation and biology to be addressed effectively. The event will kick-off with a keynote from a biology expert where challenges in a particular domain are presented, related data sources and existing efforts are discussed, and eventually a series of motivating scientific questions are posed to motivate the rest of the event. Following the keynote, the session will involve hands-on activity by groups of visualisation researchers, paired up with a domain scientist. Groups will be working on the sub-problems highlighted at the keynote, characterising the problem further, and sketching solutions and ideas in a format that best suits them (from pen and paper, to sketchy prototypes) to eventually develop a proposal for further research. The event will then conclude with the groups reporting back their approach, and participants will be encouraged to continue working on the problems through further collaborations using their produced proposals as a starting point.

The output of the workshop will be a list of well-characterized visualization challenges within the context of the problem domain. The organizers, together with the participants, will externalize these challenges in the form of a report or publication following the event.

### Biological Context & Speakers
We are currently working on determining the scientific theme, and the speakers of this year’s workshop. We will be updating this area with further information as we clarify the details. For the moment, you can refer to last year’s workshop page below to get a feel of the scope of the event.
